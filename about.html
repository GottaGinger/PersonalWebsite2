      <p>
        Based in Ohio, Sierra has been doing odd things that people have continually worried about. When will be the next time she licks a 
        salt lamp? Or sing a shanty? When will she scream into the void and wait for it to cry back? Is there a time in which the darkness
        does it's job? Do not talk to the robed figures at the dog park. Do not go to the dog park. There are demons in the dog park. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sierra likes long walks in the sand of time, coralling insects to do her bidding, and keeping the coral from mermaids.
